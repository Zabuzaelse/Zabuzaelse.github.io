        <p>It was very difficult for us to come up with ideas for a simple game on scratch. At first we wanted to make a tic tac toe game because we thought it would be simple to code. Then as we went along with the coding it was very difficult to make the game. The player versus ai was very difficult to make therefore we decided to change the game. Instead of making the tic tac toe game, we decided to just make a simple shooter game. The coding was very simple for the shooter. We just added sprites which were the bats, made them move around with the movement code, and added sound effects with the provided sound from scratch. The hardest part of the shooter game was to add scoring and make the background switch to another screen after you beat the game. It took a lot of trial and error with coding, but after looking at other coding for shooter games on scratch we solved the coding error. My partner and I both worked on the project mostly at the house. We picked a background from the selections provided by scratch along with simple sound effects that was provided also. The coding was done by both of us with a help from a friend. We used the tips provided by scratch in order to solve most of our coding errors. Overall it was a fun project.

<p>In this video I will show you how each command works. Each question leads into different scenarios of the story. One is yes and one is no, while others give you an option on what action to do. Both lead into different scenarios in the story.

 There was a lot of brainstorming between my partner and I. We had many different ideas about what our story will be, but in the end we both came to a conclusion to do a cartoon short story game. The flowchart was relatively easy as well as creating the introduction. We then moved on to coding. The most difficult part was creating a function for each question and trying to find out if our code worked well. Sometimes we would get nothing on the screen, while other times our answers lead to nothing, for example if we typed in y for yes it would lead us to “none”. There were many errors involved in the process, but in the end we solved it by seeking help from a teacher and a friend. At first the functions were very hard to put in the correct place because it had to have a certain spacing to it in order to move on to the other question. As I kept making mistakes, I learned from them also. Now functions are easy for me to do.

<p>You are the main character Ben. You have an alien technology called the omnitrix. It allows you to transform into different types of aliens with different abilities. You have plenty of enemies from different galaxies wanting to square up with you everyday. Your objective is to save your grandpa that has been captured by Dr.Animo. Dr.Animo is a very powerful villain with the abilities to turn into an insect and summon his giant frog. You also have powers. You can transform into different types of aliens. Make sure you pick the right alien for the right situation. As of now you have three choices to choose from. One is four arms which has super strength. The other alien that you can choose from is heatblast which has the ability to shoot fire and fly. Finally your last choice is the ability to upgrade your current self. You are able to evolve into a copy of Dr.Animo’s giant frog but better. </p>
