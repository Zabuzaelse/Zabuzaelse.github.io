        <p>It was very difficult for us to come up with ideas for a simple game on scratch. At first we wanted to make a tic tac toe game because we thought it would be simple to code. Then as we went along with the coding it was very difficult to make the game. The player versus ai was very difficult to make therefore we decided to change the game. Instead of making the tic tac toe game, we decided to just make a simple shooter game. The coding was very simple for the shooter. We just added sprites which were the bats, made them move around with the movement code, and added sound effects with the provided sound from scratch. The hardest part of the shooter game was to add scoring and make the background switch to another screen after you beat the game. It took a lot of trial and error with coding, but after looking at other coding for shooter games on scratch we solved the coding error. My partner and I both worked on the project mostly at the house. We picked a background from the selections provided by scratch along with simple sound effects that was provided also. The coding was done by both of us with a help from a friend. We used the tips provided by scratch in order to solve most of our coding errors. Overall it was a fun project.
