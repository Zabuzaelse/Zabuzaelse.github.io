  		<h1>Tkinter - RSA</h1>
	<h2>Written Response</h2>
<p>For our project we used a program called Thunkable. Thunkable allows us to create app on an android based phone. The coding was relatively simple due to the fact that thunkable provides most of the basic coding. For example, if you wanted a button to work you go to the button menu then click when button is pressed do this. Overall the basic function are very easy to use.

The purpose of our program was to create a game similar to pong. Our game uses the same algorithm with the ball bouncing off the walls and hitting the bottom bar which moves from left to right. The program uses sounds as well as images to give the game a unique look. The coding was pretty simple except that we had bugs where the ads won’t show and the sound won’t work.

The screenshots we took illustrates the main menu, how to play instructions, as well as the function of the game. The game has a top score counter, a current score counter, a play button as well as a menu button.. The ads are placed on the bottom right under the score counters. The background images are inspired from a tv show called Rick and Morty. It was my partner's idea to utilize that as our game theme.</p>
